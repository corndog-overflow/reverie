A lightweight, no-nonsense private journaling desktop application for daydreamers with busy lives.

I made Reverie as a solo project for BostonHacks2024, I even designed the logo! I wanted to make Reverie because I found digital journaling apps to be gimmicky, bloated and unintuitive, and because I lost my physical journals.

Reverie uses SQLite to store your journal entries locally, so your thoughts are yours alone.
With a beautiful, minimalistic design, Reverie is effortless to use and reminiscing has never been easier.
